  Title: 'Bomb Scare! '
  Description: Someone has called in a bomb scare! While everyone in the building
    evacuates, you must use the sound of the ticking bomb to find which package it
    is hidden in and to stop it from exploding! Click on the box you think the ticking
    is coming from. You have three chances to guess the correct package, otherwise
    you die! If you guess it right, you stop the bomb from going off and you get
    to live another day. Yay!
